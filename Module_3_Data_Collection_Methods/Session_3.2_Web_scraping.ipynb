    "Data collection is a procedure of gathering information from subjects (all relevant sources), measuring and analyzing accurate insights for research using various techniques. Researchers can evaluate their research questions and hypotheses on the basis of collected data. In most cases, data collection is the primary and most important step for research, irrespective of the field of study. The approach of data collection varies for different fields of study, depending on the required information.\n",

In addtion to APIs, web scraping is often the only way we can access data that it is not available in convenient CSV exports or APIs. Websites are often valuable sources of data; for example, weather forecasts, comments on news sites, and posts on forums. To access those sorts of information on webpages, we will use web scraping.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed), a web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "HTML language can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meanings in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page.

    "As already mentioned, HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider the following line of text:\n",

    "### Anatomy of an HTML document\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual HTML elements aren't very useful on their own. Next, let's examine how individual elements combine to form an entire HTML page:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html lang=\"en-US\">\n",
    "  <head>\n",
    "    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n",
    "    <title>My test page</title>\n",
    "  </head>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <p>This is my page</p>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The doctype. When HTML was young (1991-1992), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML. More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `<html></html>`: The `<html>` element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `<head></head>`: The `<head>` element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, **that isn't the content** the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `<meta charset=\"utf-8\">`: The `<meta>` element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like `<base>`, `<link>`, `<script>`, `<style>` or `<title>`. The charset attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `<title></title>`: The `<title>` element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `<body></body>`: The `<body>` element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each HTML document can actually be referred to as a document tree. We describe the elements in the tree like we would describe a family tree. There are ancestors, descendants, parents, children and siblings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the sample HTML document below for the following examples. The `<head>` section of the document is omitted for brevity.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Parent and Child\n",

    "A parent is an element that is directly above and connected to an element in the document tree. In the diagram below, the `<div>` is a parent to the `<ul>`.\n",
