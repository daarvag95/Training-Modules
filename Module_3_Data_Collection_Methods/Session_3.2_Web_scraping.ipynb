    "Data collection is a procedure of gathering information from subjects (all relevant sources), measuring and analyzing accurate insights for research using various techniques. Researchers can evaluate their research questions and hypotheses on the basis of collected data. In most cases, data collection is the primary and most important step for research, irrespective of the field of study. The approach of data collection varies for different fields of study, depending on the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet is an absolutely massive source of data which we can access by various ways such as connecting APIs (see Teaching Module 3.1. API harvesting). In addtion to APIs, web scraping is often the only way we can access data that it is not available in convenient CSV exports or APIs. Websites are often valuable sources of data; for example, weather forecasts, comments on news sites, and posts on forums. To access those sorts of information on webpages, we will use web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this online module, we are going to show how to do web scraping with Python from scratch. Then, we will work through an actual web scraping project, focusing on ??? data."

    "In order to access APIs, you first need to create an account and apply to have a developer account on the platform that you want to work on. With this developer account, platforms provide you KEYS (e.g., secret, public, or access) to authenticate their system.\n",
    "\n",
    "While web scraping is one of the common ways of collecting data from websites, a lot of websites offer APIs to access the public data that they host on their website. This is to avoid unnecessary traffic on the websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even though we have access to these API, as researchers, we should not forget to respect API access rules and always read the documents before collecting data.\n",

    "## 2.0 Feed Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed), a web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we introduce [feedparser](https://pypi.org/project/feedparser/), a powerful python package for parsing RSS feeds. By providing the RSS feed link, we can get structured information in the form of python lists and dictionaries, which could then be used to extract the desired information in a simple and efficient way."

She was pregnant.\\n\\n\\nRosa is not her real name, but she told VOA that her journey to reach the United States, along with her partner and father of her child, was difficult. Four times during their migration, Rosa thought she was going to lose her baby.\\n\\n\\nThe couple traversed the uninhabitable Darien Gap jungle linking Colombia and Panama before crossing nine countries to face a complex immigration process in the United States.\\n\\n\\n“Everyone thinks that once you arrive in this country, you will see buildings like the ones in New York City,” Rosa told a VOA reporter who met with her in Washington, D.C., and the eastern state of Delaware.\\n\\n\\nBut since the 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant arrived in Washington on one of the first 120 buses sent by Texas Republican Governor Gregg Abbott, she said her feelings changed.\\n\\n\\n“Yes, I regret having come to the United States,” Rosa said in Spanish.\\n\\n\\nAbbott launched the program in April to protest Democratic President Joe Biden\\'s approach on immigration, chartering buses to send recently arrived migrants from the southern border to the U.S. capital. Arizona Republican Governor Doug Ducey followed suit in May.\\n\\n\\nAt the D.C. bus station, Rosa told VOA about her plans.\\n\\n\\n“Work, start fulfilling my dreams, my goals that I have here,” she said.\\n\\n\\nNow living in Delaware, Rosa is in the late stages of pregnancy. Her partner, who is also from Venezuela and did not want to be identified, also said the United States isn’t what he thought.\\n\\n\\nRosa and her partner are required to check in weekly with U.S. immigration officials through a smartphone application. They hope to apply for asylum. In the meantime, they await the birth of their daughter.\\n\\n\\n“One thing is me telling this story, which is very different from living it,” Rosa said of not knowing if they can stay in the U.S. “Many people don’t understand because they think this is the American dream. But it’s a dream that, in reality, if something were to happen to me here, this dream was not worth it.”\\n\\n\\nAccording to border officials, 207,416 people tried to cross the Southwest border in June, a 14% drop from May. Of those, 92,274 people were immediately expelled from the United States under a public health order named Title 42.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDisinformation plays a role\\n\\n\\nImmigration experts say disinformation is crucial in encouraging unauthorized migration.\\n\\n\\nAt the U.S.-Mexico border, immigration experts say some migrants cross into the U.S. without authorization and then wait for border officers; others present themselves at a U.S. port of entry and ask for help.\\n\\n\\nImmigration attorney Miriam Osorio says many have false expectations. Upon arriving at the border, he told VOA, they believe officials “are going to let me in ... I am going to have a work permit, I am going to have benefits and I am going to start living peacefully in the United States.\\n\\n\\n“That\\'s not so true,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nLuis Paoli, who has worked for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency as deputy chief counsel, says migrants allowed into the country receive a U.S. government document, but it doesn’t grant legal status.\\n\\n\\nPaoli says the document, known as a notice to appear, gives migrants 30 days to check in with U.S. immigration authorities once they arrive at their final destination in the United States.\\n\\n\\n\"And if the person doesn\\'t show up, then the judge can issue a deportation order in absentia,” he said.\\n\\n\\nU.S. law offers asylum to people facing persecution in their home countries on the basis of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular group.\\n\\n\\nThough there are two kinds of asylum, affirmative and defensive, not all asylum claims come from migrants arriving at the border. Immigrants may claim affirmative asylum within one year of their last arrival in the United States or request a defensive asylum while fighting an order of deportation.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), immigration courts have a backlog of 1.6 million cases of asylum and other immigration applications. The wait time for a hearing on an immigrant\\'s asylum claim is about five years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore resources needed\\n\\n\\nAs migrants continue to arrive in Washington from Texas- and Arizona-chartered buses, a recently arrived Colombian asylum-seeker shared his story of the barriers he faced after he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\n\\nLuis Huertas was one of more than 6,000 migrants who arrived in Washington between April and July.\\n\\n\\nHuertas was assaulted in the nation’s capital shortly after he arrived.\\n\\n\\n“He attacked me and punched me very hard,” he told VOA.\\n\\n\\nLuis said he went to a local hospital. But without documents, he didn’t receive immediate medical attention. His case is not the exception. Local officials say that while Washington is a sanctuary city, it is overwhelmed by the flow of migrants. The mayor\\'s office even requested help from the federal government.\\n\\n\\n\"Money, time, and human resources are needed,” said Larry Villegas from Washington’s Office of Human Rights, “because the D.C. government alone will not be able to cover this need.”\\n\\n\\nNonprofits such as CARECEN have stepped up to help migrants when they arrive from Texas.\\n\\n\\nInitially, volunteers provided migrants with information, food, and shelter for three days. However, more than 140 buses have arrived in Washington from Texas and Arizona.\\n\\n\\nThe demand has overwhelmed nonprofits.\\n\\n\\n“When people come now, because they keep coming, they will find that it is not much,” CARECEN Director Abel Nunez told VOA, referring to what little remains of free food and temporary shelter resources. “There is less than there was before and what there was before was not enough.”\\n\\n\\nRecently, the Biden administration directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide basic care for those arriving in Washington. But even with these resources, advocates say, it is not enough.\\n\\n\\n“Initially, there were families who welcomed immigrants into their own homes. We had a two-week shelter for a very small group, but opportunities to have long-term housing for immigrants have truly never existed,” Tatiana Laborde, managing director at SAMU First Response, told VOA.\\n\\n\\nLuis Huertas arrived at that same conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s impossible to get opportunities, a job, maybe a home, when doors are closed to you just because you don\\'t have papers,” he said.\\n\\n\\nDespite the obstacles these immigrants are facing, every week about 500 migrants are arriving in Washington living similar stories.',\n",

The wait time for a hearing on an immigrant\\'s asylum claim is about five years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore resources needed\\n\\n\\nAs migrants continue to arrive in Washington from Texas- and Arizona-chartered buses, a recently arrived Colombian asylum-seeker shared his story of the barriers he faced after he crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\n\\nLuis Huertas was one of more than 6,000 migrants who arrived in Washington between April and July.\\n\\n\\nHuertas was assaulted in the nation’s capital shortly after he arrived.\\n\\n\\n“He attacked me and punched me very hard,” he told VOA.\\n\\n\\nLuis said he went to a local hospital. But without documents, he didn’t receive immediate medical attention. His case is not the exception. Local officials say that while Washington is a sanctuary city, it is overwhelmed by the flow of migrants. The mayor\\'s office even requested help from the federal government.\\n\\n\\n\"Money, time, and human resources are needed,” said Larry Villegas from Washington’s Office of Human Rights, “because the D.C. government alone will not be able to cover this need.”\\n\\n\\nNonprofits such as CARECEN have stepped up to help migrants when they arrive from Texas.\\n\\n\\nInitially, volunteers provided migrants with information, food, and shelter for three days. However, more than 140 buses have arrived in Washington from Texas and Arizona.\\n\\n\\nThe demand has overwhelmed nonprofits.\\n\\n\\n“When people come now, because they keep coming, they will find that it is not much,” CARECEN Director Abel Nunez told VOA, referring to what little remains of free food and temporary shelter resources. “There is less than there was before and what there was before was not enough.”\\n\\n\\nRecently, the Biden administration directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide basic care for those arriving in Washington. But even with these resources, advocates say, it is not enough.\\n\\n\\n“Initially, there were families who welcomed immigrants into their own homes. We had a two-week shelter for a very small group, but opportunities to have long-term housing for immigrants have truly never existed,” Tatiana Laborde, managing director at SAMU First Response, told VOA.\\n\\n\\nLuis Huertas arrived at that same conclusion.\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s impossible to get opportunities, a job, maybe a home, when doors are closed to you just because you don\\'t have papers,” he said.\\n\\n\\nDespite the obstacles these immigrants are facing, every week about 500 migrants are arriving in Washington living similar stories.'},\n",

The introduction of this bill is a victory for every veteran and front-line civilian who had been affected by the Afghan withdrawal,” said Chris Purdy, director of Veterans for American Ideals and Outreach at U.S.-based Human Rights First.

       "   'summary': 'Increasing numbers of Somali immigrants living in the western U.S. city of Seattle are facing homelessness due to soaring rental prices that exacerbate other economic and refugee hardships, activists told VOA.\\n\\n\\nThe community activists say hundreds of Somalis have lost their places of residence over the past year, unable to pay the monthly rent. Some are lucky enough to move in with relatives or friendly families; others are forced into public shelters or are living on the streets.\\n\\n\\nHamdi Abdulle is the director of Seattle’s African Community Housing and Development, an organization that works to provide homes, education, jobs and food access for refugees.\\n\\n\\nShe says many refugees from Somalia and other African countries face tough situations from the moment they arrive in the United States.\\n\\n\\n“The reasons are clear. They come to this country empty-handed, the welfare they get from the government is not enough and the rental prices skyrocket. All these factors combined are the reasons they face evictions and eventually become homeless,” Abdulle said.\\n\\n\\nSahra Bashir Farah – better known to many as Mama Shara -- is the director of Somali Community Services of Seattle.\\n\\n\\n“The whole city became very expensive when it came to housing,” she says. “For example, the rental cost of a house for a family, which used to be $1,000 [per month] is now $3,000. Our Somali people are low-income people. They cannot afford this exorbitantly expensive rent.”\\n\\n\\nFarah says the situation has forced many Somali immigrants to relocate to suburban areas such as Tukwila and SeaTac, where rental prices are lower. Living in the suburbs, however, makes it hard for them to reach their places of employment, and cuts them off from the markets, mosques and community centers they know and on which they rely.\\n\\n\\nYoung people make up the majority of homeless Somalis seen on the streets of Seattle.\\n\\n\\nA common misconception within the Somali community is that youth on the streets are rebellious, headstrong runaways or on drugs.\\n\\n\\nThe truth is different, according to Abdulle.\\n\\n\\n“The reason is when the youth are in the ages between 16-18, they leave their families thinking they can be independent, but when they leave, things become more difficult, and they face more economic challenges that finally lead them to homelessness.”\\n\\n\\nOther community members who risk homelessness are those who entered the U.S. on Diversity Immigrant Visas, as these visa holders are ineligible for public assistance and must wait years before they can qualify for federal benefits such as Medicaid.\\n\\n\\nThe Diversity Immigrant Visa Program — popularly known as the green card lottery — is a program authorized by Congress where 55,000 green cards per year are reserved for immigrants around the world to promote diversity in the U.S. Registration starts well before any given fiscal year to allow time for processing applications.\\n\\n\\nFarah says the tight-knit Somali community finds housing as quickly as possible for those who have lost their apartments or houses.\\n\\n\\n“We help each other,” she says. “We look for other houses for the homeless and if it is a family, instead of staying in public or spending [time] out in the streets, we seek help from friends and other families to provide temporary shelter.”\\n\\n\\nHundreds of thousands of Somalis have relocated to the United States over the past three decades, seeking to escape chronic conflict and poverty in their homeland. Estimates of the number of Somali immigrants in Seattle vary widely, from just several thousand to more than 30,000.\\n\\n\\nThe Somalis share the challenges of poverty, unsafe neighborhoods, poor schooling, and language barriers that many other African immigrants and refugees face upon moving to the U.S.\\n\\n\\nBut when it comes to housing issues, they are the most hit because they live in Washington, one of the most expensive states in the U.S., where housing prices are continually rising due to high demand, a shortage of homes and local zoning laws that sometimes limit the number of people in a residence.\\n\\n\\nMama Sahra’s non-profit has received millions of dollars in grants from the government for homeless prevention and other community services. She says she wants to pull those who were forced out of the city back to Seattle.\\n\\n\\nVOA’s Aline Barros contributed to this report.',\n",

Armory to assist with the reception of migrants into the city, according to U.S. military officials. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Friday that the district might send an amended, \"more specific\" request, adding that she thought this was the first time a D.C. request for National Guard assistance had been denied.\\n\\n\\nOne official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision not yet made public, said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s food and shelter program had provided funding for the problem and had indicated those funds were sufficient at this point.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBowser, the district\\'s Democratic mayor, formally asked the White House last month for an open-ended deployment of 150 National Guard members per day as well as a \"suitable federal location\" for a mass housing and processing center, mentioning the D.C. Armory as a logical candidate.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDuring the spring, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, both Republicans, announced plans to send busloads of migrants to the District of Columbia, in response to President Joe Biden\\'s decision to lift a pandemic-era emergency health order that restricted migrant entry numbers. On Friday, Abbott said the first group of migrants from his state had now been bused to New York as well.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs of mid-July, about 5,200 migrants had been bused from Texas to D.C. since April and more than 1,100 from Arizona, which started in May. The governors call the practice a voluntary free ride — paid for by state taxpayers — that gets migrants closer to family or support networks.\\n\\n\\n\\'Tricked\\'\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut Bowser last month dismissed that characterization, saying that the asylum-seekers were being \"tricked,\" as many don\\'t get close enough to their final destinations and some are ditched at Union Station near the U.S. Capitol and the White House. Often they arrive with no resources and no clue what to do next.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, Bowser told reporters that the Pentagon appears to be concerned \"about the open-ended nature of our request.\" and that a more specific one would help.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs and to assure that political considerations are not a part of their decision,\" Bowser said, adding that she believes the \"crisis\" will only worsen. \"We need the National Guard. If we were a state, I would have already done it.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA coalition of local charitable groups has been working to feed and shelter the migrants, aided by a $1 million grant from FEMA. But organizers have been warning that both their resources and personnel were nearing exhaustion.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"This reliance on NGOs is not working and is unsustainable — they are overwhelmed and underfunded,\" Bowser said in her letter. She has repeatedly stated that the influx is stressing her government\\'s ability to care for its own homeless residents and now requires a federal response.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBowser sharply criticized Abbott and Ducey, accusing them of \"cruel political gamesmanship\" and saying the pair had \"decided to use desperate people to score political points.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExplaining his decision to add New York City as a destination, Abbott said that Biden\\'s \"refusal to acknowledge the crisis caused by his open border policies\" forced Texas to \"take unprecedented action to keep our communities safe.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHe said the migrants were being dropped off at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,\" Abbott said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\'Political pawns\\'\\n\\n\\nIn response, Fabien Levy, spokesman for Adams, tweeted that Abbott\\'s \"continued use of human beings as political pawns is disgusting. NYC will continue to welcome asylum-seekers w/ open arms, as we have always done, but we still need support from DC.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs mayor of D.C., Bowser does not have the authority to personally order a National Guard deployment, an issue that has become emotionally charged in recent years as a symbol of the district\\'s entrenched status as less than a state.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHer limited authority played a role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump.

       "   'summary': 'Visitors to the United States, whether for business, education or leisure travel, are facing significant wait times for visas. Some international travelers are waiting six months to a year to schedule a visa interview, State Department data show.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe reason, said David Bier, associate director of immigration policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, is the two-year, pandemic-induced lockdown of U.S. consulates around the world that halted visa services.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“They just stopped doing work during COVID. And that produced what we\\'re seeing now, which is year-plus waits, massive backlogs and all the problems associated with that,” he told VOA.\\n\\n\\nThough wait times vary significantly from consulate to consulate, Bier said, “it is the worst it\\'s ever been since 9/11.” \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIndeed, nearly two years after the 2001 terrorist attacks, a State Department official told a House committee hearing on visa services that “the vast majority of our cases are completed within three weeks.”\\n\\n\\nBut nearly 2½ years after the pandemic began, according to a July report by Bier, there is an “astounding eight‑month wait to visit the United States for a period of at most just 90 days.”\\n\\n\\n“In July 2022, student visa interviews are backlogged 49 days — five times the wait pre‐pandemic. Temporary work visas are backed up 75 days — up from 12.

       "   'summary': 'The Supreme Court on Monday certified its month-old ruling allowing the Biden administration to end a cornerstone Trump-era border policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court, a pro forma act that has drawn attention amid near-total silence from the White House about when, how and even whether it will dismantle the policy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe two-word docket entry read \"judgment issued\" to record that the justices voted 5-4 in a ruling issued June 30 that the administration could scrap the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, overruling a lower court that forced the policy to be reinstated in December.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said shortly after the Supreme Court victory that justices would need to communicate the decision to a lower court, which, in turn, should lift the order to keep the policy in place in a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas. Beyond that, administration officials have said little, including whether any of the thousands subject to the policy since December will be allowed to enter and remain in the United States while their cases are being considered in immigration court.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe White House and Homeland Security Department had no immediate comment on the Supreme Court certification; the Justice Department declined comment. Officials in Mexico had no immediate comment.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout 70,000 migrants were subject to the policy, known officially as \"Migrant Protection Protocols,\" or MPP, from when former President Donald Trump introduced it in January 2019 until President Joe Biden suspended it on his first day in office in January 2021, fulfilling a campaign promise. Many were allowed to return to the United States to pursue their cases during the early months of Biden\\'s presidency.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNearly 5,800 people have been subject to the policy from December through June, according to figures released Friday, a modest number that would make any reluctance to end it seem less plausible. Nicaraguans account for the largest number, with others from Cuba, Colombia and Venezuela.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nA sign posted last week at the entrance to the Salvation Army migrant shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, by the United Nations\\' International Organization for Migration appeared to best capture the public understanding of the policy\\'s status: \"Wait for official information! The Remain in Mexico (MPP) program remains in effect.

       "    'value': 'The Supreme Court on Monday certified its month-old ruling allowing the Biden administration to end a cornerstone Trump-era border policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court, a pro forma act that has drawn attention amid near-total silence from the White House about when, how and even whether it will dismantle the policy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe two-word docket entry read \"judgment issued\" to record that the justices voted 5-4 in a ruling issued June 30 that the administration could scrap the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, overruling a lower court that forced the policy to be reinstated in December.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said shortly after the Supreme Court victory that justices would need to communicate the decision to a lower court, which, in turn, should lift the order to keep the policy in place in a lawsuit filed by the state of Texas. Beyond that, administration officials have said little, including whether any of the thousands subject to the policy since December will be allowed to enter and remain in the United States while their cases are being considered in immigration court.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe White House and Homeland Security Department had no immediate comment on the Supreme Court certification; the Justice Department declined comment. Officials in Mexico had no immediate comment.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout 70,000 migrants were subject to the policy, known officially as \"Migrant Protection Protocols,\" or MPP, from when former President Donald Trump introduced it in January 2019 until President Joe Biden suspended it on his first day in office in January 2021, fulfilling a campaign promise. Many were allowed to return to the United States to pursue their cases during the early months of Biden\\'s presidency.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNearly 5,800 people have been subject to the policy from December through June, according to figures released Friday, a modest number that would make any reluctance to end it seem less plausible. Nicaraguans account for the largest number, with others from Cuba, Colombia and Venezuela.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nA sign posted last week at the entrance to the Salvation Army migrant shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, by the United Nations\\' International Organization for Migration appeared to best capture the public understanding of the policy\\'s status: \"Wait for official information! The Remain in Mexico (MPP) program remains in effect. The United States government will inform you of any changes.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCritics of the policy have been increasingly outspoken about the Biden administration\\'s reticence on \"Remain in Mexico,\" and Monday\\'s certification renewed their calls for an immediate end to the policy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a zombie policy,\" said Karen Tumlin, founder of Justice Action Center, an immigration litigation organization.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe final move may rest with U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in Amarillo, Texas, a Trump appointee whose ruling last year brought \"Remain in Mexico\" back.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Arizona began moving in shipping containers to close a 1,000-foot gap in the border wall near the southern Arizona farming community of Yuma on Friday, with officials saying they were acting to stop migrants after repeated, unfulfilled promises from the Biden administration to block off the area.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe move by Arizona comes without explicit permission on federal land, with state contractors starting to move in 18.3-meter (60-foot) shipping containers and stacking two of the 2.7-meter-tall (9-foot-tall) containers on top of each other early Friday. They plan to complete the job within days, and the containers will be topped with 1.2 meters (4 feet) of razor wire, said Katie Ratlief, Republican Governor Doug Ducey\\'s deputy chief of staff.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe state plans to fill three gaps in the border wall constructed during former President Donald Trump\\'s tenure in the coming weeks totaling 914.4 meters (3,000 feet).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"The federal government has committed to doing this, but we cannot wait for their action,\" Ratlief said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJohn Mennell, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency had just learned of Arizona\\'s action and \"is not prepared to comment at this time.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEnd of \\'Remain in Mexico\\'\\n\\n\\nThe move is the latest pushback by a Republican-led border state to what it contends is inaction by Democratic President Joe Biden on immigration. It was prompted by the end of the \"Remain in Mexico\" program that was announced this week, said Ducey\\'s top lawyer, Annie Foster. That program required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico and await a court date, although thousands of migrants who make it into the country were not returned.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey is using $6 million for the project out of $335 million the Legislature authorized in June to construct virtual or physical fencing along the border with Mexico.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey, who co-chairs the Republican Governors Association, and other GOP politicians have tapped into border security as a potent political foil in an election year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration announced late last month that it had authorized completion of the Trump-funded U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma. The area has become one of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings, and plans called for filling in four wide gaps. Arizona officials said they did not know why there was a discrepancy between the three gaps they identified and the federal government\\'s plans.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBiden had pledged during his campaign to cease all future wall construction, but the administration later agreed to some barriers, citing safety. The Department of Homeland Security planned work to close four wide gaps in the wall near Yuma to better protect migrants who can slip down a slope or drown walking through a low section of the Colorado River.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized completion of the project near the Morelos Dam in July, a move officials said reflected the administration\\'s \"priority to deploy modern, effective border measures and also improving safety and security along the southwest border.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArizona points to a rising number of migrants coming into the state and accompanying drug smuggling as a major reason for their action. Agents stopped migrants more than 160,000 times from January through June in the Yuma sector, nearly quadruple from the same period last year. The only other Border Patrol sectors with more traffic were Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley in south Texas.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDespite the federal promise to fill in the gaps, Arizona officials said no action had been taken. The federal government apparently put the project out to bid this week, but that may take weeks or months.',\n",

They plan to complete the job within days, and the containers will be topped with 1.2 meters (4 feet) of razor wire, said Katie Ratlief, Republican Governor Doug Ducey\\'s deputy chief of staff.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe state plans to fill three gaps in the border wall constructed during former President Donald Trump\\'s tenure in the coming weeks totaling 914.4 meters (3,000 feet).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"The federal government has committed to doing this, but we cannot wait for their action,\" Ratlief said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJohn Mennell, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency had just learned of Arizona\\'s action and \"is not prepared to comment at this time.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEnd of \\'Remain in Mexico\\'\\n\\n\\nThe move is the latest pushback by a Republican-led border state to what it contends is inaction by Democratic President Joe Biden on immigration. It was prompted by the end of the \"Remain in Mexico\" program that was announced this week, said Ducey\\'s top lawyer, Annie Foster. That program required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico and await a court date, although thousands of migrants who make it into the country were not returned.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey is using $6 million for the project out of $335 million the Legislature authorized in June to construct virtual or physical fencing along the border with Mexico.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey, who co-chairs the Republican Governors Association, and other GOP politicians have tapped into border security as a potent political foil in an election year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration announced late last month that it had authorized completion of the Trump-funded U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma. The area has become one of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings, and plans called for filling in four wide gaps. Arizona officials said they did not know why there was a discrepancy between the three gaps they identified and the federal government\\'s plans.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBiden had pledged during his campaign to cease all future wall construction, but the administration later agreed to some barriers, citing safety. The Department of Homeland Security planned work to close four wide gaps in the wall near Yuma to better protect migrants who can slip down a slope or drown walking through a low section of the Colorado River.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized completion of the project near the Morelos Dam in July, a move officials said reflected the administration\\'s \"priority to deploy modern, effective border measures and also improving safety and security along the southwest border.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArizona points to a rising number of migrants coming into the state and accompanying drug smuggling as a major reason for their action. Agents stopped migrants more than 160,000 times from January through June in the Yuma sector, nearly quadruple from the same period last year. The only other Border Patrol sectors with more traffic were Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley in south Texas.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDespite the federal promise to fill in the gaps, Arizona officials said no action had been taken. The federal government apparently put the project out to bid this week, but that may take weeks or months.'},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Increasing numbers of Somali immigrants living in the western U.S. city of Seattle are facing homelessness due to soaring rental prices that exacerbate other economic and refugee hardships, activists told VOA.\\n\\n\\nThe community activists say hundreds of Somalis have lost their places of residence over the past year, unable to pay the monthly rent. Some are lucky enough to move in with relatives or friendly families; others are forced into public shelters or are living on the streets.\\n\\n\\nHamdi Abdulle is the director of Seattle’s African Community Housing and Development, an organization that works to provide homes, education, jobs and food access for refugees.\\n\\n\\nShe says many refugees from Somalia and other African countries face tough situations from the moment they arrive in the United States.\\n\\n\\n“The reasons are clear. They come to this country empty-handed, the welfare they get from the government is not enough and the rental prices skyrocket. All these factors combined are the reasons they face evictions and eventually become homeless,” Abdulle said.\\n\\n\\nSahra Bashir Farah – better known to many as Mama Shara -- is the director of Somali Community Services of Seattle.\\n\\n\\n“The whole city became very expensive when it came to housing,” she says. “For example, the rental cost of a house for a family, which used to be $1,000 [per month] is now $3,000.

Armory to assist with the reception of migrants into the city, according to U.S. military officials. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Friday that the district might send an amended, \"more specific\" request, adding that she thought this was the first time a D.C. request for National Guard assistance had been denied.\\n\\n\\nOne official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision not yet made public, said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s food and shelter program had provided funding for the problem and had indicated those funds were sufficient at this point.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBowser, the district\\'s Democratic mayor, formally asked the White House last month for an open-ended deployment of 150 National Guard members per day as well as a \"suitable federal location\" for a mass housing and processing center, mentioning the D.C. Armory as a logical candidate.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDuring the spring, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, both Republicans, announced plans to send busloads of migrants to the District of Columbia, in response to President Joe Biden\\'s decision to lift a pandemic-era emergency health order that restricted migrant entry numbers. On Friday, Abbott said the first group of migrants from his state had now been bused to New York as well.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs of mid-July, about 5,200 migrants had been bused from Texas to D.C. since April and more than 1,100 from Arizona, which started in May. The governors call the practice a voluntary free ride — paid for by state taxpayers — that gets migrants closer to family or support networks.\\n\\n\\n\\'Tricked\\'\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut Bowser last month dismissed that characterization, saying that the asylum-seekers were being \"tricked,\" as many don\\'t get close enough to their final destinations and some are ditched at Union Station near the U.S. Capitol and the White House. Often they arrive with no resources and no clue what to do next.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, Bowser told reporters that the Pentagon appears to be concerned \"about the open-ended nature of our request.\" and that a more specific one would help.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs and to assure that political considerations are not a part of their decision,\" Bowser said, adding that she believes the \"crisis\" will only worsen. \"We need the National Guard. If we were a state, I would have already done it.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA coalition of local charitable groups has been working to feed and shelter the migrants, aided by a $1 million grant from FEMA. But organizers have been warning that both their resources and personnel were nearing exhaustion.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"This reliance on NGOs is not working and is unsustainable — they are overwhelmed and underfunded,\" Bowser said in her letter. She has repeatedly stated that the influx is stressing her government\\'s ability to care for its own homeless residents and now requires a federal response.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBowser sharply criticized Abbott and Ducey, accusing them of \"cruel political gamesmanship\" and saying the pair had \"decided to use desperate people to score political points.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExplaining his decision to add New York City as a destination, Abbott said that Biden\\'s \"refusal to acknowledge the crisis caused by his open border policies\" forced Texas to \"take unprecedented action to keep our communities safe.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHe said the migrants were being dropped off at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,\" Abbott said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\'Political pawns\\'\\n\\n\\nIn response, Fabien Levy, spokesman for Adams, tweeted that Abbott\\'s \"continued use of human beings as political pawns is disgusting. NYC will continue to welcome asylum-seekers w/ open arms, as we have always done, but we still need support from DC.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs mayor of D.C., Bowser does not have the authority to personally order a National Guard deployment, an issue that has become emotionally charged in recent years as a symbol of the district\\'s entrenched status as less than a state.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHer limited authority played a role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. When it became clear that crowds were overwhelming Capitol Police, Bowser couldn\\'t immediately deploy the district guard. Instead, crucial time was lost while the request was considered inside the Pentagon, and protesters rampaged through the building.',\n",

The governors call the practice a voluntary free ride — paid for by state taxpayers — that gets migrants closer to family or support networks.\\n\\n\\n\\'Tricked\\'\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut Bowser last month dismissed that characterization, saying that the asylum-seekers were being \"tricked,\" as many don\\'t get close enough to their final destinations and some are ditched at Union Station near the U.S. Capitol and the White House. Often they arrive with no resources and no clue what to do next.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, Bowser told reporters that the Pentagon appears to be concerned \"about the open-ended nature of our request.\" and that a more specific one would help.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"We want to continue to work with the Department of Defense so that they understand our operational needs and to assure that political considerations are not a part of their decision,\" Bowser said, adding that she believes the \"crisis\" will only worsen. \"We need the National Guard. If we were a state, I would have already done it.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA coalition of local charitable groups has been working to feed and shelter the migrants, aided by a $1 million grant from FEMA. But organizers have been warning that both their resources and personnel were nearing exhaustion.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"This reliance on NGOs is not working and is unsustainable — they are overwhelmed and underfunded,\" Bowser said in her letter. She has repeatedly stated that the influx is stressing her government\\'s ability to care for its own homeless residents and now requires a federal response.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBowser sharply criticized Abbott and Ducey, accusing them of \"cruel political gamesmanship\" and saying the pair had \"decided to use desperate people to score political points.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nExplaining his decision to add New York City as a destination, Abbott said that Biden\\'s \"refusal to acknowledge the crisis caused by his open border policies\" forced Texas to \"take unprecedented action to keep our communities safe.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHe said the migrants were being dropped off at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,\" Abbott said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\'Political pawns\\'\\n\\n\\nIn response, Fabien Levy, spokesman for Adams, tweeted that Abbott\\'s \"continued use of human beings as political pawns is disgusting. NYC will continue to welcome asylum-seekers w/ open arms, as we have always done, but we still need support from DC.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAs mayor of D.C., Bowser does not have the authority to personally order a National Guard deployment, an issue that has become emotionally charged in recent years as a symbol of the district\\'s entrenched status as less than a state.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHer limited authority played a role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of former President Donald Trump. When it became clear that crowds were overwhelming Capitol Police, Bowser couldn\\'t immediately deploy the district guard. Instead, crucial time was lost while the request was considered inside the Pentagon, and protesters rampaged through the building.'},\n",

Some international travelers are waiting six months to a year to schedule a visa interview, State Department data show.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe reason, said David Bier, associate director of immigration policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, is the two-year, pandemic-induced lockdown of U.S. consulates around the world that halted visa services.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“They just stopped doing work during COVID. And that produced what we\\'re seeing now, which is year-plus waits, massive backlogs and all the problems associated with that,” he told VOA.\\n\\n\\nThough wait times vary significantly from consulate to consulate, Bier said, “it is the worst it\\'s ever been since 9/11.” \\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIndeed, nearly two years after the 2001 terrorist attacks, a State Department official told a House committee hearing on visa services that “the vast majority of our cases are completed within three weeks.”\\n\\n\\nBut nearly 2½ years after the pandemic began, according to a July report by Bier, there is an “astounding eight‑month wait to visit the United States for a period of at most just 90 days.”\\n\\n\\n“In July 2022, student visa interviews are backlogged 49 days — five times the wait pre‐pandemic.

       "  'summary': 'The Biden administration has authorized completion of the Trump-funded U.S.-Mexico border wall in an open area of southern Arizona near Yuma that has become one of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBiden had pledged during his campaign to cease all future wall construction, but the administration later agreed to some barriers, citing safety. The Department of Homeland Security said Thursday the work to close four wide gaps in the wall near Yuma will better protect migrants who can slip down a slope or drown walking through a low section of the Colorado River.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe agency said in a statement that Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized completion of the project near the Morelos Dam, reflecting the administration\\'s \"priority to deploy modern, effective border measures and also improving safety and security along the Southwest Border.\" It was initially to be funded by the Defense Department but will now be paid for out of Homeland Security\\'s 2021 budget.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Border Patrol Yuma sector has quickly emerged as the third busiest of nine sectors along the border, with much of the traffic funneling through the Morelos Dam. Migrants arrive in the small town of Algodones and walk unencumbered across a concrete ledge on the dam to U.S. soil, where they wait for Border Patrol agents to take them into custody.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompletion of the wall was at the top of former President Donald Trump\\'s agenda, and border security remains a potent issue for candidates of both parties going into this year\\'s primary elections. President Joe Biden halted new wall construction after he took office, but he has since made closing the gaps just south of Yuma a priority.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who is seeking his party nomination\\'s next week to defend the seat in November, has pressed the Biden administration to close the gaps, calling them a challenge for officials trying to secure the border.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAgents stopped migrants more than 160,000 times from January through June in the Yuma sector, nearly quadruple from the same period last year. The only other sectors with more traffic were Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley in South Texas.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe area has been especially attractive to Colombians, Venezuelans and others who have flown to Mexicali, Mexico, and taken a short bus or taxi ride to Algodones to walk across the border before being released into the United States.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBut Arizona environmentalist Myles Traphagen, who has been mapping ecological damage left by border wall construction under the Trump administration, said that closing the gaps won\\'t be much of a deterrent.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTraphagen said the Yuma area has \"become the new Ellis Island for Arizona, with people arriving there from countries as disparate as Ethiopia, Cuba, Russia, Ukraine, India, Colombia and Nicaragua.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"People have traveled halfway around the globe on planes, trains and automobiles,\" he said, \"so to expect that closing four small gaps is going to make them turn around and book a return flight on Air Ethiopia is sheer fallacy.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nA 5-year-old migrant girl crossing the water in a group drowned near the dam June 6 when she became separated from her mother. The child\\'s body was later found in the river.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nU.S. officials didn\\'t release the girl\\'s identity or nationality. But Jamaican newspapers have said she was believed to be from that country.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIt was unclear when construction would begin. The statement said officials will move \"as expeditiously as possible, while still maintaining environmental stewardship\" by consulting affected parties.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAdvocates in San Diego say the Border Patrol there has told them of plans to erect two 9.1-meter high bollard-style barriers through the border\\'s iconic Friendship Park.

John Fanestil of Friends of Friendship Park, a group that advocates for public access to the binational park inaugurated in 1971 by-then first lady Pat Nixon.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEnvironmentalists like Traphagen, meanwhile, have called for removal of other sections of barrier they say hurt local wildlife like bobcats, mountain lions, javelinas and mule deer.',\n",

They plan to complete the job within days, and the containers will be topped with 1.2 meters (4 feet) of razor wire, said Katie Ratlief, Republican Governor Doug Ducey\\'s deputy chief of staff.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe state plans to fill three gaps in the border wall constructed during former President Donald Trump\\'s tenure in the coming weeks totaling 914.4 meters (3,000 feet).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"The federal government has committed to doing this, but we cannot wait for their action,\" Ratlief said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJohn Mennell, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency had just learned of Arizona\\'s action and \"is not prepared to comment at this time.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEnd of \\'Remain in Mexico\\'\\n\\n\\nThe move is the latest pushback by a Republican-led border state to what it contends is inaction by Democratic President Joe Biden on immigration. It was prompted by the end of the \"Remain in Mexico\" program that was announced this week, said Ducey\\'s top lawyer, Annie Foster. That program required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico and await a court date, although thousands of migrants who make it into the country were not returned.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey is using $6 million for the project out of $335 million the Legislature authorized in June to construct virtual or physical fencing along the border with Mexico.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey, who co-chairs the Republican Governors Association, and other GOP politicians have tapped into border security as a potent political foil in an election year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration announced late last month that it had authorized completion of the Trump-funded U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma. The area has become one of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings, and plans called for filling in four wide gaps. Arizona officials said they did not know why there was a discrepancy between the three gaps they identified and the federal government\\'s plans.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBiden had pledged during his campaign to cease all future wall construction, but the administration later agreed to some barriers, citing safety. The Department of Homeland Security planned work to close four wide gaps in the wall near Yuma to better protect migrants who can slip down a slope or drown walking through a low section of the Colorado River.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized completion of the project near the Morelos Dam in July, a move officials said reflected the administration\\'s \"priority to deploy modern, effective border measures and also improving safety and security along the southwest border.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArizona points to a rising number of migrants coming into the state and accompanying drug smuggling as a major reason for their action.

They plan to complete the job within days, and the containers will be topped with 1.2 meters (4 feet) of razor wire, said Katie Ratlief, Republican Governor Doug Ducey\\'s deputy chief of staff.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe state plans to fill three gaps in the border wall constructed during former President Donald Trump\\'s tenure in the coming weeks totaling 914.4 meters (3,000 feet).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"The federal government has committed to doing this, but we cannot wait for their action,\" Ratlief said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nJohn Mennell, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said the agency had just learned of Arizona\\'s action and \"is not prepared to comment at this time.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEnd of \\'Remain in Mexico\\'\\n\\n\\nThe move is the latest pushback by a Republican-led border state to what it contends is inaction by Democratic President Joe Biden on immigration. It was prompted by the end of the \"Remain in Mexico\" program that was announced this week, said Ducey\\'s top lawyer, Annie Foster. That program required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico and await a court date, although thousands of migrants who make it into the country were not returned.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey is using $6 million for the project out of $335 million the Legislature authorized in June to construct virtual or physical fencing along the border with Mexico.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDucey, who co-chairs the Republican Governors Association, and other GOP politicians have tapped into border security as a potent political foil in an election year.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration announced late last month that it had authorized completion of the Trump-funded U.S.-Mexico border wall near Yuma. The area has become one of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings, and plans called for filling in four wide gaps. Arizona officials said they did not know why there was a discrepancy between the three gaps they identified and the federal government\\'s plans.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBiden had pledged during his campaign to cease all future wall construction, but the administration later agreed to some barriers, citing safety. The Department of Homeland Security planned work to close four wide gaps in the wall near Yuma to better protect migrants who can slip down a slope or drown walking through a low section of the Colorado River.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas authorized completion of the project near the Morelos Dam in July, a move officials said reflected the administration\\'s \"priority to deploy modern, effective border measures and also improving safety and security along the southwest border.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArizona points to a rising number of migrants coming into the state and accompanying drug smuggling as a major reason for their action. Agents stopped migrants more than 160,000 times from January through June in the Yuma sector, nearly quadruple from the same period last year. The only other Border Patrol sectors with more traffic were Del Rio and Rio Grande Valley in south Texas.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nDespite the federal promise to fill in the gaps, Arizona officials said no action had been taken.

They come to this country empty-handed, the welfare they get from the government is not enough and the rental prices skyrocket. All these factors combined are the reasons they face evictions and eventually become homeless,” Abdulle said.\\n\\n\\nSahra Bashir Farah – better known to many as Mama Shara -- is the director of Somali Community Services of Seattle.\\n\\n\\n“The whole city became very expensive when it came to housing,” she says. “For example, the rental cost of a house for a family, which used to be $1,000 [per month] is now $3,000. Our Somali people are low-income people. They cannot afford this exorbitantly expensive rent.”\\n\\n\\nFarah says the situation has forced many Somali immigrants to relocate to suburban areas such as Tukwila and SeaTac, where rental prices are lower. Living in the suburbs, however, makes it hard for them to reach their places of employment, and cuts them off from the markets, mosques and community centers they know and on which they rely.\\n\\n\\nYoung people make up the majority of homeless Somalis seen on the streets of Seattle.\\n\\n\\nA common misconception within the Somali community is that youth on the streets are rebellious, headstrong runaways or on drugs.\\n\\n\\nThe truth is different, according to Abdulle.\\n\\n\\n“The reason is when the youth are in the ages between 16-18, they leave their families thinking they can be independent, but when they leave, things become more difficult, and they face more economic challenges that finally lead them to homelessness.”\\n\\n\\nOther community members who risk homelessness are those who entered the U.S. on Diversity Immigrant Visas, as these visa holders are ineligible for public assistance and must wait years before they can qualify for federal benefits such as Medicaid.\\n\\n\\nThe Diversity Immigrant Visa Program — popularly known as the green card lottery — is a program authorized by Congress where 55,000 green cards per year are reserved for immigrants around the world to promote diversity in the U.S. Registration starts well before any given fiscal year to allow time for processing applications.\\n\\n\\nFarah says the tight-knit Somali community finds housing as quickly as possible for those who have lost their apartments or houses.\\n\\n\\n“We help each other,” she says. “We look for other houses for the homeless and if it is a family, instead of staying in public or spending [time] out in the streets, we seek help from friends and other families to provide temporary shelter.”\\n\\n\\nHundreds of thousands of Somalis have relocated to the United States over the past three decades, seeking to escape chronic conflict and poverty in their homeland. Estimates of the number of Somali immigrants in Seattle vary widely, from just several thousand to more than 30,000.\\n\\n\\nThe Somalis share the challenges of poverty, unsafe neighborhoods, poor schooling, and language barriers that many other African immigrants and refugees face upon moving to the U.S.\\n\\n\\nBut when it comes to housing issues, they are the most hit because they live in Washington, one of the most expensive states in the U.S., where housing prices are continually rising due to high demand, a shortage of homes and local zoning laws that sometimes limit the number of people in a residence.\\n\\n\\nMama Sahra’s non-profit has received millions of dollars in grants from the government for homeless prevention and other community services.

Living in the suburbs, however, makes it hard for them to reach their places of employment, and cuts them off from the markets, mosques and community centers they know and on which they rely.\\n\\n\\nYoung people make up the majority of homeless Somalis seen on the streets of Seattle.\\n\\n\\nA common misconception within the Somali community is that youth on the streets are rebellious, headstrong runaways or on drugs.\\n\\n\\nThe truth is different, according to Abdulle.\\n\\n\\n“The reason is when the youth are in the ages between 16-18, they leave their families thinking they can be independent, but when they leave, things become more difficult, and they face more economic challenges that finally lead them to homelessness.”\\n\\n\\nOther community members who risk homelessness are those who entered the U.S. on Diversity Immigrant Visas, as these visa holders are ineligible for public assistance and must wait years before they can qualify for federal benefits such as Medicaid.\\n\\n\\nThe Diversity Immigrant Visa Program — popularly known as the green card lottery — is a program authorized by Congress where 55,000 green cards per year are reserved for immigrants around the world to promote diversity in the U.S. Registration starts well before any given fiscal year to allow time for processing applications.\\n\\n\\nFarah says the tight-knit Somali community finds housing as quickly as possible for those who have lost their apartments or houses.\\n\\n\\n“We help each other,” she says. “We look for other houses for the homeless and if it is a family, instead of staying in public or spending [time] out in the streets, we seek help from friends and other families to provide temporary shelter.”\\n\\n\\nHundreds of thousands of Somalis have relocated to the United States over the past three decades, seeking to escape chronic conflict and poverty in their homeland. Estimates of the number of Somali immigrants in Seattle vary widely, from just several thousand to more than 30,000.\\n\\n\\nThe Somalis share the challenges of poverty, unsafe neighborhoods, poor schooling, and language barriers that many other African immigrants and refugees face upon moving to the U.S.\\n\\n\\nBut when it comes to housing issues, they are the most hit because they live in Washington, one of the most expensive states in the U.S., where housing prices are continually rising due to high demand, a shortage of homes and local zoning laws that sometimes limit the number of people in a residence.\\n\\n\\nMama Sahra’s non-profit has received millions of dollars in grants from the government for homeless prevention and other community services. She says she wants to pull those who were forced out of the city back to Seattle.\\n\\n\\nVOA’s Aline Barros contributed to this report.'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-number-of-somali-immigrants-face-homelessness-in-seattle/6697676.html'}, {'length': '0', 'type': 'image/jpeg', 'href': 'https://gdb.voanews.com/019e0000-0aff-0242-a8d2-08da7bb69a5f_w800_h450.jpg', 'rel': 'enclosure'}], 'link': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-number-of-somali-immigrants-face-homelessness-in-seattle/6697676.html', 'id': 'https://www.voanews.com/a/rising-number-of-somali-immigrants-face-homelessness-in-seattle/6697676.html', 'guidislink': False, 'published': 'Thu, 11 Aug 2022 13:05:39 -0400', 'published_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2022, tm_mon=8, tm_mday=11, tm_hour=17, tm_min=5, tm_sec=39, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=223, tm_isdst=0), 'tags': [{'term': 'USA', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}, {'term': 'Immigration', 'scheme': None, 'label': None}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Mohamed Olad Hassan, Jafar Fidow', 'email': 'webdesk@voanews.com'}], 'author': 'webdesk@voanews.com (Mohamed Olad Hassan, Jafar Fidow)', 'author_detail': {'name': 'Mohamed Olad Hassan, Jafar Fidow', 'email': 'webdesk@voanews.com'}}\n",

The cards would not be an official form of federal identification, and would state they are to be used by the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\n\\nThe idea is for immigrants to be able to access information about their cases online by using a card rather than paper documents that are cumbersome and can fade over time, officials said. They said ICE officers could also run checks on the cards in the field.\\n\\n\\n\"Moving to a secure card will save the agency millions, free up resources, and ensure information is quickly accessible to DHS officials while reducing the agency\\'s FOIA backlog,\" an ICE spokesperson said in a statement, referring to unfulfilled public requests for agency documents. Homeland Security gets more Freedom of Information Act requests than any other federal agency, according to government data, and many of those involve immigration records.\\n\\n\\nThe proposal has sparked a flurry of questions about what the card might be used for and how secure it would be. Some fear the program could lead to tracking of immigrants awaiting their day in immigration court, while others suggest the cards could advertised by migrant smugglers to try to induce others to make the dangerous trip north.\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration is seeking $10 million for the so-called ICE Secure Docket Card in a budget proposal for the next fiscal year. It was not immediately clear if the money would cover the pilot or a broader program or when it would begin.\\n\\n\\nThe administration has faced pressure as the number of migrants seeking to enter the country on the southwest border has increased. Border Patrol agents stopped migrants more than 1.1 million times from January to June, up nearly one-third from the same period of an already-high 2021.\\n\\n\\nMany migrants are turned away under COVID-19-related restrictions. But many are allowed in and either are detained while their cases churn through the immigration courts or are released and required to check in periodically with ICE officers until a judge rules on their cases.\\n\\n\\nThose most likely to be released in the United States are from countries where expulsion under the public health order is complicated due to costs, logistics or strained diplomatic relations, including Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.\\n\\n\\nAt shelters, bus stations and airports along the U.S.-Mexico border, migrants carefully guard their papers in plastic folders. These are often the only documents they have to get past airport checkpoints to their final destinations in the United States.

The cards would not be an official form of federal identification, and would state they are to be used by the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\n\\nThe idea is for immigrants to be able to access information about their cases online by using a card rather than paper documents that are cumbersome and can fade over time, officials said. They said ICE officers could also run checks on the cards in the field.\\n\\n\\n\"Moving to a secure card will save the agency millions, free up resources, and ensure information is quickly accessible to DHS officials while reducing the agency\\'s FOIA backlog,\" an ICE spokesperson said in a statement, referring to unfulfilled public requests for agency documents. Homeland Security gets more Freedom of Information Act requests than any other federal agency, according to government data, and many of those involve immigration records.\\n\\n\\nThe proposal has sparked a flurry of questions about what the card might be used for and how secure it would be. Some fear the program could lead to tracking of immigrants awaiting their day in immigration court, while others suggest the cards could advertised by migrant smugglers to try to induce others to make the dangerous trip north.\\n\\n\\nThe Biden administration is seeking $10 million for the so-called ICE Secure Docket Card in a budget proposal for the next fiscal year. It was not immediately clear if the money would cover the pilot or a broader program or when it would begin.\\n\\n\\nThe administration has faced pressure as the number of migrants seeking to enter the country on the southwest border has increased. Border Patrol agents stopped migrants more than 1.1 million times from January to June, up nearly one-third from the same period of an already-high 2021.\\n\\n\\nMany migrants are turned away under COVID-19-related restrictions. But many are allowed in and either are detained while their cases churn through the immigration courts or are released and required to check in periodically with ICE officers until a judge rules on their cases.\\n\\n\\nThose most likely to be released in the United States are from countries where expulsion under the public health order is complicated due to costs, logistics or strained diplomatic relations, including Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua.\\n\\n\\nAt shelters, bus stations and airports along the U.S.-Mexico border, migrants carefully guard their papers in plastic folders.

military and White House officials.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nBowser, a Democrat, has asked in recent weeks for federal funds to provide shelter and services to migrants arriving on buses from the two Republican-led states, which sought to make a political statement by sending border crossers to Washington.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\"Our ability to assist people in need at this scale is very limited,\" Bowser said in a letter to White House officials, adding that nonprofit organizations welcoming migrants in Washington are \"overwhelmed and underfunded.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican running for reelection in November midterm elections, blames U.S. President Joe Biden\\'s immigration policies for record numbers of migrant arrests at the border with Mexico.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe governor announced in April the state would bus migrants to Washington, saying \"Texas should not have to bear the burden of the Biden administration’s failure to secure our border.\"\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTexas has sent more than 150 buses carrying more than 6,000 migrants to Washington since April, according to Abbott\\'s office.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nArizona Governor Doug Ducey, another Republican, launched a similar effort in May and has bused more than 1,000 migrants, his office has said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAbout 85% to 90% of the arriving migrants continue to other U.S. destinations by bus or plane, according to two groups working to welcome the migrants in Washington.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nMigrant advocates and Washington city council members have called on Bowser to devote city funds to the reception effort, but the mayor has said the federal government must step in.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, another Democrat, has similarly said in recent weeks that migrant arrivals have taxed his city\\'s shelter system and called on the Biden administration to provide funding.'}, 'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href':
